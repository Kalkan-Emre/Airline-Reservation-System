# Programming-Assignment-2
<b>Objective of this programming assigment:</b> <br>
In this programming assignment, you are first expected to implement a binary search tree data structure, in which each
node will contain the data and two pointers to the root nodes of its left and right subtrees. The binary search tree
data structure will include a single pointer that points to the root node of the binary search tree. The details of the
structure are explained further in the following sections. Then, you will use this specialized binary search tree structure
to implement an airline reservation system.
